***Accessibility Tester***
Accessibility Tester is a Python program designed to help website owners and developers test the accessibility of their sites. It checks every accessibility aspect of the site, including color contrast, font sizes, alternative text, and more.

**Requirements**
Windows OS
AccessibilityTester.exe
**Installation**
Simply download the AccessibilityTester.exe file and run it on your Windows machine. No installation is required since the program has been compiled with PyInstaller.

**Usage**
Open the program by double-clicking on the AccessibilityTester.exe file.
Enter the URL of the website you want to test in the input field and click on the "Run Test" button.
Wait for the program to finish testing. This may take a few minutes depending on the size and complexity of the website.
View the results in the program window. The results will be grouped by category (e.g. color contrast, font sizes, etc.) and will include detailed information about any accessibility issues found.
